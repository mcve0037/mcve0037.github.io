        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <!-- About me/interests -->
    <p>
        My name is Mathieu McVeety. Iâ€™m a French-Canadian from a small town in Northern Ontario. Ever since I was a kid, I had a big interest in arts and forms to express my creativity. I used to always draw onto paper, usually things from TV shows I used to watch or anything my imagination would come up with. Nowadays, <em>I <strong>love</strong> animation, video games and film.</em> 
    </p>
        <!-- About my education/goal -->
    <p>I chose the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program at Algonquin College because of the courses it contained. I have a little bit of experience in coding, since I did C# in 10<sup>th</sup> and 11<sup>th</sup> grade of high school, although I did forget most of it since its been a while. I also took media arts, film, and animation classes in high school. This program has a lot of my interests and things I enjoy. <em>My goal is to find a career in any of these fields.</em>
