I began creating this portfolio in my User Experience Design class. The main idea for my portfolio website is to have a site that would be able to serve as a place to demonstrate a bit of my work and have a area where people can contact me for work. While creating the code for the website, I can across a few issues including the footer and navigation mainly. The issues were mostly revolving around the responsivity and changing the screen sizes. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a way to resolve these issues effectively. I will look into these issues more deeply in the future and try to find a way to resolve them before putting this website to use, if I chose to do so.
While coding this website, I was able to use more bootstrap, more specifically in the creation of the grid systems. I was able to use my prior knowledge of bootstrap and apply it onto this portfolio website. I learnt about "img-fluid" class for boostrap that automatically applies the width="100%" and height="auto" to the images to make them responsive. I wasn't aware of this class beforehand, so using it for my images in the site helped a lot.

Most of the content of this website was created my me, including the images and logo. The only content that wasn't made by me was the main banner for the frontpage. I was able to find that copyright-free image on the website Unsplash.com
